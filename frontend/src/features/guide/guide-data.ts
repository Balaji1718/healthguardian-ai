      "Interact with a safe, grounded AI Assistant that only uses your records",
    ],
    beginnerExplanation:
      "Think of HealthGuardian as your personal wellness notebook combined with smart pattern recognition. It observes your daily habits over time—like how much you sleep, drink water, or exercise—and highlights when things change from your normal baseline.",
    learnMoreExplanation:
      "Unlike generic health apps that compare everyone to a rigid population average, HealthGuardian focuses on your personal baseline. It understands that 6 hours of sleep might be normal for one person but an unusual drop for another.",
    technicalDetails:
      "All baseline calculations, deviations, trend vectors, and confidence metrics are calculated deterministically by local algorithms in the application, ensuring zero AI hallucination of vital statistics.",
