 * test-voice-audio-quality.js — Phase 10C-Fix Audio Capture Quality & Lifecycle Invariants Test Suite
 *
 * Verifies:
 * 1. Pure Web Speech API architecture (zero getUserMedia / MediaRecorder secondary streams to eliminate hardware echo)
 * 2. No live speaker loopback / destination routing
 * 3. Audio playback support via speech synthesis
 * 4. Dev-only diagnostics registry
 * 5. Continuous speech recognition auto-restart
 * 6. Non-destructive transcript accumulation
